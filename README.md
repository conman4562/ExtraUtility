# ExtraUtility / Content Warning Mod
Are your friends annoying little idiots who use the push mod?
This mod has:
CLIENT SIDE
Anti-Ragdoll toggle (stops you from ever being ragdolled, including the push mod)
Infinite stamina toggle
Infinite health toggle
Infinite oxygen toggle
A toggle for sprinting in all directions
A slider to change your speed
I plan to add more but that's it for now
SERVER SIDE (Must be host)
Nothing yet...
